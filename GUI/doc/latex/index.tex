\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
Welcome to the Zappy Project documentation. This project is a tribute to Zaphod Beeblebrox and involves creating a network game where several teams confront each other on a tile map containing resources. The goal of the game is for the first team to have at least six players reach the maximum elevation.\hypertarget{index_components_sec}{}\doxysection{Project Components}\label{index_components_sec}
The project consists of three main binaries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily zappy\+\_\+server}\+: The server written in C that generates the inhabitants\textquotesingle{} world.
\item {\ttfamily zappy\+\_\+gui}\+: The graphical client written in C++ to visualize the world.
\item {\ttfamily zappy\+\_\+ai}\+: The AI client that drives an inhabitant through commands sent to the server.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each of these components has specific build rules defined in the Makefile.\hypertarget{index_environment_sec}{}\doxysection{Environment}\label{index_environment_sec}
The game takes place in a world called Trantor, which is made of zero-\/relief planes. The game board represents the entire surface of this world, with a wrap-\/around effect at the edges.\hypertarget{index_resources_subsec}{}\doxysubsection{Resources}\label{index_resources_subsec}
The environment is rich in resources, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Linemate
\item Deraumere
\item Sibur
\item Mendiane
\item Phiras
\item Thystame
\end{DoxyItemize}

These resources are spawned by the server upon starting and at regular intervals.\hypertarget{index_activities_subsec}{}\doxysubsection{Activities}\label{index_activities_subsec}
The inhabitants of Trantor focus on two main activities\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Feeding themselves
\item Collecting stones
\end{DoxyItemize}

These activities are crucial for the elevation ritual, which is an important part of the game.\hypertarget{index_elevation_sec}{}\doxysection{Elevation Ritual}\label{index_elevation_sec}
The goal for players is to rise in the \mbox{\hyperlink{classTrantorian}{Trantorian}} hierarchy by performing the elevation ritual. This involves gathering specific resources and having a certain number of players of the same level on the same tile. Successful elevation enhances the players\textquotesingle{} capacities and advances them to the next level.\hypertarget{index_vision_sec}{}\doxysection{Vision}\label{index_vision_sec}
Players\textquotesingle{} field of vision increases with each level of elevation. The {\ttfamily look} command allows players to see the objects and players on the tiles around them.\hypertarget{index_communication_sec}{}\doxysection{Communication}\label{index_communication_sec}
The AI clients communicate with the server using TCP sockets, and the commands are sent as character strings ending with a newline. The server responds with confirmation messages for each action.\hypertarget{index_gui_sec}{}\doxysection{Graphical User Interface}\label{index_gui_sec}
The graphical client provides a 2D (or optionally 3D) visualization of the world, using icons to represent various elements. The GUI communicates with the server and updates the visualization based on the game\textquotesingle{}s state.\hypertarget{index_commands_sec}{}\doxysection{Commands}\label{index_commands_sec}
Players can perform various actions such as moving, turning, looking around, broadcasting messages, and performing the elevation ritual. These commands are transmitted through the server and must follow the defined protocol.\hypertarget{index_reproduction_sec}{}\doxysection{Player Reproduction}\label{index_reproduction_sec}
Players can reproduce by laying eggs, which allows new clients to connect and join the game.\hypertarget{index_protocols_sec}{}\doxysection{Protocols and Standards}\label{index_protocols_sec}
The project adheres to specific protocols for communication and game mechanics, ensuring consistency and functionality across all components.
