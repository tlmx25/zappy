> The goal of the AI is to control a drone (the player) to replicate the behavior of a Trantor, advancing it to the highest elevation level.

> [!NOTE]
> Since the bot's information can be used against us, we will not provide any explanation on how it works. Only the overall functionality of the classes and the architecture will be presented.
